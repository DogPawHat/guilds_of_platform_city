Depending on how many of the same symbol you are touching at the time of your action, you'll be able to perform different things:  
1. __Quest:__ If you are touching at *least one* of a symbol, you convince a character to do a quest for you (meaning you'll play them, perform their ability, and discard them)  
2. __Join your fellowship:__ If you are touching at least two of the same symbol, you are convincing a character to become a permanent member of your team. (meaning you'll keep them face up in front of you, and will get influence points from there loyalty at the end).  
3. __Get the keys to there guild:__ If you are touching three of the same symbol, they love you and you get the keys to their guild (meaning you'll take there guild's token and will have a guaranteed place in their guild for as long as you keep it).  
- Keys of the (city?) guild are also worth one Influence point  
- If you are standing on a symbol and you have the key to that guild, you count two.  
- If you are standing on two symbols and have the key of that guild, you count three  
- If another player stands in three of the symbol you've earned the keys of the guild, they will become their new favorite, meaning they will take the keys off you and keep them until someone takes it off them.
