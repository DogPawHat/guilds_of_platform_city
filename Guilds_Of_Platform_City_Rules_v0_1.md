<ol>
<li><strong>Quest:</strong> If you are touching at <em>least one</em> of a symbol, you convince a character to do a quest for you (meaning you’ll play them, perform their ability, and discard them)</li>
<li><strong>Join your fellowship:</strong> If you are touching at least two of the same symbol, you are convincing a character to become a permanent member of your team. (meaning you’ll keep them face up in front of you, and will get influence points from there loyalty at the end).</li>
<li><strong>Get the keys to there guild:</strong> If you are touching three of the same symbol, they love you and you get the keys to their guild (meaning you’ll take there guild’s token and will have a guaranteed place in their guild for as long as you keep it).</li>

<li>Keys of the (city?) guild are also worth one Influence point</li>
<li>If you are standing on a symbol and you have the key to that guild, you count two.</li>
<li>If you are standing on two symbols and have the key of that guild, you count three</li>
